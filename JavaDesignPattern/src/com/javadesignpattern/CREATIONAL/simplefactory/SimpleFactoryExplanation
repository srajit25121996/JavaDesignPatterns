* Simple Factory is creational design pattern that helps you to create multiple different object,
  based one simple criteria of choice.
  
* We basically define object instantiation/creation login into a separate class,
  and most commonly in a static method of this class
  
* In simple words we can say that it is encapsulation of your instantiation logic, 
  nothing complex goes in that method.
